To me, food is more than just fuel. Of course, it gives us energy, but I think the real value lies in how it connects people. For example, I remember when I studied abroad, I sometimes felt lonely. But whenever I cooked a meal and shared it with my friends, I immediately felt a sense of belonging. So Iâ€™d say food plays a social and emotional role as well.
